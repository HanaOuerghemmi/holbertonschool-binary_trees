## üí° a binary tree:

In our Holberton school group project pair programing we work on and understanding `A BINARY TREE`,

## üìù Description: 

`a binary tree`  is a tree data structure where each node has up to two child nodes, creating the branches of the tree. The two children are usually called the left and right nodes. Parent nodes are nodes with children, while child nodes may include references to their parents.

## üìù Important Terms:
<p> 
<strong> Root </strong> The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.
</p>
<p> 
<strong> parent  </strong> Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.
</p>
<p> 
<strong> Child </strong> The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.
</p>
<p> 
<strong> Grandparents  </strong> A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent.
</p>
<p> 
<strong> Uncle </strong> the child of grandparents
</p>
<p> 
<strong> Cousins </strong> the child of uncle if it exists.
</p>
<p> 
<strong> Siblings </strong> Nodes with the same parent.
</p>
<p> 
<strong> Leaf </strong> The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.
</p>
<p> 
<strong> Ancestor </strong> a node that is at the upper level of the given node.
</p>
<p> 
<strong> Subtree </strong> Subtree represents the descendants of a node.
</p>
<p> 
<strong> Depth of the nodes </strong> The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.
</p>
<p> 
<strong> Height of the node </strong> The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest downward path between that node and a leaf
</p>
<p> 
<strong> Edge </strong> Connection between one node to another.
</p>

### üñ• type of trees:
<p> 
<strong> Binary tree is full </strong> is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.
</p>
<p> 
<strong> Binary tree is perfect </strong> is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level.
</p>
<p> 
<strong> Binary tree is complete </strong> is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is comilled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
</p>
<p> 
<strong> Binary tree is balanced </strong> is a binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1
</p>

### Binary Search Tree: 
A binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties: The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
